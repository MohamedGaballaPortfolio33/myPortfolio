># Introducing Myself
>First, let me introduce myself my name is Mohamed Gaballa and I have received my Bachelor's in Science degree in Computer Science at Southern New Hampshire University. I have transferred from a Community College called Ocean County College to get my Associate in Science in Computer Science degree.  Below is my ePortfolio Capstone of how I completed my coursework and some narratives of how I enhanced and improved an existing project. 

># Professional Self-Assessment  
>When I begin college, I did not know how to program or how programming works. I was new to learning programming for the first time when attending Ocean County College and Southern New Hampshire University. After taking my first programming class I had realized how exciting it will be and how analyzing problems need to really think about the solution very carefully by writing algorithms and UMLS. The first programming language that I have learned is JAVA and the next was Assembly Language. 

>From, entering Southern New Hampshire I had some experience of using JAVA and creating documents for a database. When, realizing how much work I had already carried out after graduating from my community college, and what I will be doing next from obtaining my bachelor's degree in my next journey. I have noticed that programming for a course in college that looks like I was already working with a company and I was a professional programmer. Then SNHU taught me how to program using a new programming language called Python. I never knew that there was a different type of programming language that has noticeably short to use when coding. The type of program to put in software to make a project to work without dealing with scanners or adding variables before beginning to code just like JAVA needs to add variables and constructors before starting to create the main method.

>During my journey at Southern New Hampshire, the coursework that I learned from my former college got, even more, the advance of how to become a better software developer after graduating from SNHU. From, reading how the technology works and the concepts of putting the software together after it is programmed. For, working with projects I have seen that becoming a programmer we need to communicate with others to get the task done. Also, not only one developer can work on a single project we need to have a team when testing the project or adding new code to an existing project. However, there was a course that I had completed that deals with putting a program together and committing it to the Bitbucket repository website to let other students from the course to create a code review and putting comments to the code to be revised. This was just like working at a workforce to communicate with stakeholders and supplying feedback to a team to begin the project like we would when we are in a meeting. 

>When I start taking software engineering courses, I was nervous about it because I never knew how to code before going to college. Since I took my first software engineering course which I need to test a project using Junit testing and creating test cases and strategies to the software to finding errors and finding bugs to be fixed. I realize that I was working just like a real software developer from the workforce in real-life solutions. Then working with C++ Programming language this is my next level of learning to develop a project using 2D and 3D graphics. From, creating a pyramid design and creating a table using vertices to create the design in modern and legacy OpenGL. 

>Data Structure and Algorithms is such a valuable tool to use in a program without Data Structure or creating Algorithms we will not have any storage or files to insert our documents to save our work or using a card or board games to keep score on the computer or mobile devices. I have taken a course from my earlier college that we had to use the stack method to create a deck of cards game. The stack was used to match the deck of cards with each other and to creating a main method to make the cards to work. Also, I have used ques to create an application from a documented example. The queue was used to bring a message from an example to be inserted in a document application. Next, we have used a binary search tree to sort and search an ordered paired item from a data. This was used to sort a node from using the Big Node notation when trying to search a specific ordering from ascending or descending order. We used JAVA in that course and were transferred through Southern New Hampshire University.

>When I took a course in data structure and algorithm category at Southern New Hampshire University. I had used what I learned on how to create a Restful API using MongoDB. In this course, we were told to create a database connection using either Python or JAVA. I had picked Python because it was better to create a MongoDB Restful API database to test and run the code. From, using the MongoDB Shell in using the terminal in Codio or in Visual Studio I have created statements to insert, read, update, and delete methods to create a JSON format document to the database.

>From, using databases to create tables and inserting documents into a database connection was a powerful way to help to find a document without going through bunch of files to find specific data. I have used Oracle SQL to use to create a database to enhance a document for sports event teams and player's files. This is one of the enhancement files that I have chosen to enhance throughout the coursework when completing my capstone course. When using Oracle SQL, we can use the CRUD operation to create, read, update, and delete a document from an existing table or creating a whole new table to insert new data into the new database connection. 

>Security is used more than ever before. A lot of companies and individual is using security to protect themselves from virus or hackers going into their documents. From, creating software to protect users from being harm or getting their identity stolen. There should be a better way to login to the user interface and supplying a stronger password to let malware or spyware be blocked from accessing the files. 

>Also, from picking a better programming language to use with your application it will let your project to be an enormous success in protecting your users of accessing to the database. This will let your software to succeed and flaw across the world because it will help the user to be safe when going on to the database. Security is the first thing to write a code for your software to be tested. For, knowing that your user is not complaining of any issues that might occur in the software application Also when creating security, it will be a clever idea to have them sign up for username first before letting the user use the application.  This will help the user to be protected and if someone else is trying to use their username it will not go through. Also, when using a software application security should be the first thing to be tested.

># Artifact Introduction

>My portfolio will prove on how to become a successful software developer when using graphic design and database documents.  Also, how to make three projects to be improvement and how to enhance a project. For the first project I was using a software engineer and design project that was created for a pyramid design using modern OpenGL and programming C++. This type of project that I was doing is for designing a pyramid by adding a new texture to the pyramid and adding a new lightbulb to make the pyramid to light up when moving the pyramid around. I was unfamiliar with how to create it at first, but when I had the ability to work with numbers and to move objects around for helping me to create a simple pyramid. Then I realized that creating this type of design needs a lot of math and numbers to create a more advanced pyramid design. To understand how to create it using a different kind of OpenGL like legacy and will let me learn OpenGL new ways of using a different programming language to create a pyramid object in OpenGL. 

>The rest of my ePortfolio will show how to create multiple documents using a database connection to log in to the server before starting to use the compiler. When I used the Codio website to create my Mongodb Restful project I knew that picking a programming language that would be easy to use was going to be a big success because this project was created with two files that will need to create to run both files one for the main and one for the server.

>Also, using the terminal to make the programs run then the compiler itself for testing the Restful API URLs and using it to insert, update, and delete the documents that were created. The final project was created to use create or update a data table using Oracle SQL. In this project, we used a schema that was used to login to the Oracle SQL database connection. If you are using Visual Studio Code then you need to open the terminal, but if you not using the compiler and using the Oracle SQL Developer complier then you do not need to open any terminal because you will already have the option to run the code to create your project and adding tables or inserting and updating data into the table. 

># Code Review Video

>In this course, we had told to create a short code review video.  Which explains more details about how these three projects will for enhancing and improving.  From, starting with an introduction of what you will see in the video and what the first project will be improving and how it will be enhancing the project.

># Artifact Description 

>The first artifact that was chosen to enhance and improve is a pyramid design project. This artifact was made to create a design in a 3D shape.  Also, to know how to design a pyramid using vertices and indices, and how to use shaders to help to draw the design.  The programming language that used to create the shape of the artifact called C++ in Modern Opengl using Visual Studio and was created from March 2, 2019, through April 26, 2019. 

># Artifact Inclusion Justification

>I selected this artifact to improve my skills of learning more about modern OpenGL because I want to know more about my artifact of how to enhance and improve a brilliant artifact. The inclusion of the artifact is to use math and graphing to create the triangle shape of the design and then repeat the vertices until the triangle turns into a pyramid. There should be only three triangles to make a pyramid, not including a floor base which needs more triangles to include for the structure display for the pyramid. 

>The old design of the pyramid is green, and the modern design of the pyramid is yellow with some design of hydrographic of Ancient Egyptian writing. This type of artifact was made using transformations and rotations of the vertex arrays.  When we use vertex arrays the shape will rotate to the shape you want to create. Also, I had mention vertices and indices without using these methods and graphing the design will not be made. To add the light and textures to the pyramid design we need to use texcords also known as texture coordinates, and the same numbers that you used for the triangles of the artifact.  I have improved the artifact by putting all comments on top of code and decreasing the spaces. This way it will be easy to read and see the code of the next line of code. There is a screenshot that shows the old design and the old texture below. 

>This is the old pyramid design

># Enhancement Plan

>The plan of enhancement was to create a new floor design and fixing the lightbulb to shape like a pyramid. Also, adding a new color to the background and a new image to the pyramid.  However, my plan did not work because the floor did not been inserted.  There is enhancement to the background of the window it was black before the improvement of the artifact and now it is blue.  When I have enhanced the project, I changed the design to a much brighter color and changing the color of the light to a better color which is now yellow. To understand something clearly, at last, you need to move the pyramid around using the ALT key and an Optical mouse so the light of the color can be seen on the pyramid display. I decided not to include the floor for the project enhancement, but everything else went smooth and created successfully. The screenshot of the new design of the pyramid and the new texture design is shown below and the movement of the light of the pyramid. 


>This is the new pyramid and background design.

># Enhancement Reflection

>When I was enhancing the artifact, I was moving the lightbulb around to make it shape has a pyramid.  The reason that the lightbulb was shrimp as a pyramid is the shadow of the pyramid structure. From, not including the lightbulb then the light will not work, and the brightness of the pyramid will be invisible because it was using a camera vision to let the pyramid be visible and it needs light to shine the display.  Also, I learned that when enhancing an existing project, it is harder, and it already was created, and it will be difficult to enhance a project that is already been made.  I only got one challenge that I have faced, and it is to create a floor design.  The floor was hard to be inserted because it was breaking my pyramid and it needs more triangles vertices to rotate the design back to the shape of the pyramid.

># [To access the project code files please click here or on the image above thank you.](https://github.com/MohamedGaballaPortfolio33/MyPortfolio/tree/master/ImprovedPythonMongodbRestfulAPI)
># Artifact Description 

>The artifact that I have chosen to implement is my MongoDB and Restful API project. This project had been made to create a database connection using the four CRUD operators (Create, Read, Update, Delete). From, using these four operators it has been used to insert documents into the database collection and using MongoDB has a connection to the server. The Programming language that was being used is Python. This assignment was created on May 6, 2019, through June 30, 2019. 

># Artifact Inclusion Justification

>I have selected this artifact because the inclusion of the artifact is used for adding new data to the same collection of ticker symbols and industry names of each company. There are some specifics of using this project for the data structure and algorithm by adding pipelines that will return the best stocks in the database and using dictionaries and hashing to create the security of the project. The artifact was improved to let new documents to be inserted or updating the documents to get new documents to appear with the rest of the old documents. 

>Also, the security was created because to allow the user to prompt in a username or password and then log in using the same username and password. If there are an existing username and password, then there will be an error message telling this username has already existed then the user will need a new username and password. After they have logout the user can go back and use the username and password the second time.  They do not need to sign up for a new username or password again. Also, if they want a second account yes, they need to sign up for a new username and password, but they can keep their old account and can have two accounts if they want a new account. 

># Enhancement Planned Review

>The plan of the enhancement was to make the project more professional like real projects on the field by supplying a way for the user to enjoy using the software. Also, allowing new ways to create the data and providing new testes that were used to test each code. The enhancement was to create two files one for the server file and one for the main file. The server file will have the URLs that will be tested to make the documents to be inserted and updating it. Also, for the security part and new documents will be in the Main method. There is some method that will bring the top 5 stocks from the most top 5 high salary stock that will be included in the documents. It will list only 5 stock that is included in the database collection and leaving the rest out. 


> From, the image below is what the output will look after a username and password were inserted. First, they need to sign up for the username before logging into the database. Once they have signed up for the username it will return a welcome message and the document will appear and the rest of the operators will show that it was updated or removed from the collection.

>This is to begin the process of running the URLs. Also, we will need to open another Terminal to begin using the URLs. That is located at the bottom of the project files.

># Enhancement Reflection

>During the enhancement process, I was able to bring the features of the security to run and adding it to the collection. I met some challenges of understanding what some of the methods and variables to include while improving the artifact, but I keep trying to add new ways to create the process to work. It was difficult to insert new documents into the project and letting the user enter a username without starting from the beginning of creating the project for the first time. Then I tried to work my way through and writing some stuff down before beginning my enhancement and I got the security and the rest of the document to work correctly. I learned as I creating my project is to keep on trying to enhance the project and always add comments to what you are doing. This is a clever way to know what each method is running and how it will work the documents that are being used in the user interface.

># [To access the project code files please click here or on the image above thank you.](https://github.com/MoGaballa32/My-ePortfolio/tree/master/ImprovedOracleSQLProject)

># Artifact Description 

>The artifact that I have picked to improve and enhance the project is Oracle SQL Project. This project was for a business that is using teams and players which was created for a database sport event. Also, the player should only have one team to play in the team. It will include CRUD operations like creating a MongoDB project this project will have the following operation (Create, Read, Update, and Delete). The artifact was created on July 2nd, 2019 through August 25, 2019. 

># Artifact Inclusion Justification

>I have selected this project because becoming an Oracle SQL developer is one of the powerful databases that anyone wishes to become. It can show how Oracle SQL really works and how it can be improved once it is created. Also, it uses an easy format that can let you learn this SQL server and it is a wonderful opportunity for any businesses to create databases or tables to use for selecting the data of their company. For example, if a company has over 100,000 customers and they all have bills to pay for a cell phone company and the company wants to track them together to see who has bills to pay or who has no payment is currently due. Then they would use Oracle SQL to get all the user's name to come up on their computers. 

>Oracle SQL showed me how to become a great developer and how to use the statements that are being used to make tables for company values for a collection interface. I am planning to become a developer once after graduation and getting a job with using Oracle. This artifact was improved from putting all the inserts, creating tables, and updating the table together except on leaving them separate. Also, I have added some new data to the existing tables from adding new teams, players, phone numbers, and adding the type of sport that each team belongs to. Also, I have created a security that can allow a user to be registered using a username and password and to be added to the connection to the database provided. This artifact is running fewer files than before and it really shows how becoming a software developer is about then just creating a project and never improving it. 

>#  Enhancement Planned Review

>The plan of the enhancement is creating a project that would be simple to follow and have new columns and rows to be included in the tables that were already created. Also, the artifact was an enormous success and it is long then were excepted because the inserts were long it has the players player id, team id, first, last names, date of birth, social, and telephone numbers. The sports team table has the team id, city, and team name which both databases were slightly difficult to add all the players on one page and all the teams on the same page. This is because I was trying to have fewer documents to have for this document and if we have the inserts separate then the artifact will look long and hard to follow. However, the new data for these two tables are separate from the old data. This way we will know what the old data is and what the old data that we have included. The screenshot below shows the two enhanced databases for the player's data and for the sports team data. For, the security statement I have added an alter session to set the oracle script to be true to create the user's account. Also, I have granted them access to all the privileges that the user can use to start the process of using the database and start creating their own tables in their own connection to the database server.


>This is the sports team data that listed the updated data and the old data for each team.

># Enhancement Reflection

>During the enhancement process, I have able to bring in everything that I have planned.  Also, everything is running smoothly when I was running the code no errors were located and everything that I have mentioned it works. However, I did come to an issue with adding the phone numbers at first it did not want to run so I went back to the altered table and see what I have done wrong. It seems like the constraints were inserted incorrectly which I had worked my way through on how to fix this issue by removing the work constraint and just adding the word add PlayersTelephone with the datatype varchar and the data size is 20. Then after fixing that next was to test it out and it works the second time the first time I have it as Add Constraint(PlayersTelephone, Like ‘(???)(???)-(????)’); this did not work, because the server did not figure out what this statement does. Also, I had some difficulty adding a username and password to create a user when I run it there was an error message occurred telling that the user cannot be created so I tried to create another way, but it still did not work.  Then I notice that there was another method to add which I need to alter the Oracle Server to equal true.  This way the server will create the username of the user and can let them have access whenever they want to sign in using their new username and password.
